# early-detection-depression
Use this [link](https://desolate-citadel-22764.herokuapp.com/) to use the web app.
We aim to develop an intelligent solution that will detect potential depression (short-term) and notify the person. We have built a ML -based solution for this. The solution recognises different human behavioral and lifestyle patterns, through data collected from wearable devices and smart phones. Our platform is intended to only detect potential depression (short-term). </br></br>
